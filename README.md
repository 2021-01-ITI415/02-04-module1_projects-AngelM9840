# Module1-Projects
I wanted my prototype to be something simple that could be played mindlessly; something that you could get into a rhythm playing and feel good about picking up a high score, 
something you could take your time with and make precise shots, or even just throw up shots with only a vague idea of direction. At first, I wanted to include a high score feature 
and multiple baskets like we did in apple picker to represent lives, but due to circumstances, I was not able to implement those. The framework I had in mind while designing this 
was the MDA framework; the mechanic of the game: firing a projectile and the dynamic: the projectile and bucket connecting are both simple on their own, but if the prototype was 
expanded upon with more advanced artwork it could create a variety of aesthetics that would influence the experience and how players receive the game. For example, if the 
slingshot was a girlfriend or boyfriend and the projectiles were personal possessions while the bucket was the other partner catching them the game may appear humorous while 
different art assets may create a different feeling in the player.
