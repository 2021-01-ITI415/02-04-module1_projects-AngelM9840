I wwanted my prototype to be something simple that could be played mindlessly; something that you could get into a rhythm playing and feel good about picking up a high score,
something you could take your time with and make precise shots, or even just throw up shots with only a vague idea of direction. At first I wanted to include a high score feature
and multiple baskets like we did in apple picker tp represent lives, but due to circumstances I was not able to implement those. The framework I had in mind while designing this
was the MDA framework; the mechanic of the game: firing a proectile and the dyanimc: the projectile and bucket connecting are both simple on their own, but if the prototype was 
expanded upon with more advanced artwork it could create a variety of aesthtetics that would influence the experience and how player receive the game. For example, if the the 
slingshot was a girlfriend or boyrfiend and the projectiles were personal possesions  while the bucket was the other partner catching them the game may appear humorous
while different art assets may creat a different feeling in the player.
